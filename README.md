# Secret Identity
A Unity game made for the Brackeys 2022.2 game jam about a superhero working an office job who has to change into his costume without being detected in order to stop a crime.

You can play the game [here](https://hadidanial.itch.io/secret-identity).


*Please note that while this repository contains all the code I wrote, it does not include the 3D models, animations, or assets we used, 
such as DOTWeen and SensorToolkit, as they are paid assets and I do not have a license to distribute them. 
As a result, the project won't run for you if you download it. 
In addition, we used Unity's built-in version control system called Plastic SCM during development, which is why the commits here are a jumbled mess - I only committed here once in a while.*

------------------------------

As a superhero working your day job in your secret identity, you must change into your hero costume and go save the day!

However... YOU'RE NOT ALONE. The office is full of people today, and you can't afford to have your identity go public! On top of that, your co-workers are all pestering you for one thing or another - work, work, work... Avoid them as best you can, find a safe private spot, and change into your costume without being detected - and before the time runs out - to save the day and preserve your secret identity!

You can use your powers to secretly disrupt the office's copy machines and the ATM (press E to interact) in order to distract your colleagues and sneak off to change (hold down F or Q to remove your clothes and put on your costume pieces, one at a time.) You can crouch and crawl (press C or CTRL to toggle crouch/stand) behind and even under some objects, and jump over them (press Spacebar to jump) to help you avoid detection.
